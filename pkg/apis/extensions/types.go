/*
This file (together with pkg/apis/extensions/v1beta1/types.go) contain the experimental
types in kubernetes. These API objects are experimental, meaning that the
APIs may be broken at any time by the kubernetes team.

DISCLAIMER: The implementation of the experimental API group itself is
a temporary one meant as a stopgap solution until kubernetes has proper
support for multiple API groups. The transition may require changes
beyond registration differences. In other words, experimental API group
support is experimental.
